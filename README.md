Task: 
1. Debug: There's a bug in the get_book function that can be triggered with certain inputs. Find and fix the bug.
2. Extend: Implement the update_book function that allows users to update a book's details (title, author). It should return the updated book if successful, or a 404 error if the book is not found.
3. Unit Test: Write a unit test for the update_book function. The test should cover at least the following scenarios:
 	    Successfully updating a book.
           Attempting to update a non-existent book (should return a 404).
